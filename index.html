    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>01-01-2026</p>

    <p>

        Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how information is handled
        when you use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information such as
        name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App can be played offline and does not require user registration.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>
        The App may use third-party services that automatically collect limited non-personal

        <li>Operating system version</li>
        <li>App usage statistics</li>
        <li>Crash and error logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is used solely to improve app performance, stability, and user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App may use third-party services such as advertising or analytics providers.
        These services may collect information in accordance with their own privacy policies.
        We do not control or take responsibility for the privacy practices of these third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

        appropriate action can be taken.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting information.
        However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot
        guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
